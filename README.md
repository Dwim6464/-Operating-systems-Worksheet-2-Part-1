## Task 1
Generally Task 1 was ok as it was just copying things. My first problem was that the command to copy the kernel

ld -T ./source/link.ld -melf_i386 loader.o -o kernel.elf

was not working. I am not really sure what the problem was as when I tried it again a few hours later it worked perfectly fine.
