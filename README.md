# -Operating-systems-Worksheet-2-Part-1
## Task 1
Generally Task 1 was ok as it was just copying things from the Worksheet 2 Part 1 pdf on blackboard. My first problem was that the command to copy the kernel

ld -T ./source/link.ld -melf_i386 loader.o -o kernel.elf

was not working. I am not really sure what the problem was as when I tried it again a few hours later it worked perfectly fine. I also had a problem getting the bootloader stage2_eltorito using the command from both the pdf Worksheet 2 Part 1 and the email sent by Eseosa on the 6th of november. <img width="1144" height="82" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70d5f63b-a025-4218-acd2-703eeb7ec4f1" /> Instead I got the file by finding the github repo mentioned on page 15 of The little book about OS development and downloading it.<img width="828" height="203" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37bbdaf2-7b89-4616-92fc-2856d8ad1dca" />

I was unfortunately disadvantaged by the maintanance that occured on November the 28th, 29th 30th, and the 1st of December as each time that I tried to connect to CSCTcloud I was met with this error. Despite the fact that the maintance was meant to end at 8am on the 1st CSCTcloud continued to be down throughout the day.
